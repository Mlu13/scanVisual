# scanVisual
The s1.py is used to scan port on the for local host. To run it, I open termianl and type "python s1.py", and then when I see "enter the host", type in "127.0.0.1" and it will shows wheter prot 1-25 is open or not. 
I then created a file called port.csv with result I got. Port 1-25 are closed for this host. In order to test the code, I manually change port 25 to open. To run the visualization, open the index.html under p5/empty-example/index.html on FireFox. I f you open it on safari, it won't work.
